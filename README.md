# Project Instructions

## Overview

In this project, you will be building a personal blog and podcast website using either React, NextJS or HTML,CSS and JS. The website will allow users to view, create, update, and delete podcasts without the need for any backend. You will use the provided JSON file as the data source for the podcasts.

## Task

Your task is to create a personal blog and podcast site where users can browse a list of blogs and podcasts, all from the user interface.

## Requirements

1. Use Whatever technology you feel comfortable with to create a new project and set up the necessary files and folders.
2. Apply CSS styles using any library that you like ex: tailwingcss, bootstrap...etc
3. Use the provided JSON file as the data source for the blogs and podcasts the file name is `db.json`.
4. Implement functionality to view the list of blogs, the podcasts should be only listed and you can't do anything else wih them.
5. Ensure that the page is responsive and displays correctly on different screen sizes.

## Steps to Follow

1. Fork the project to create your own repository.
2. Clone the initialized project from the GitHub repository provided to you.
3. Analyze the provided JSON file `db.json` within the project to understand the structure and properties of the object.
4. Set up a new project using the appropriate commands.
5. Use CSS modules or CSS-in-JS libraries to style the components and achieve a visually appealing design.
6. Fetch the podcast data from the JSON file and display it on the website pages. The command to start the server is `npm run server`
7. Test your web page in different devices to ensure responsiveness.
8. Fine-tune the design and functionality as needed.
9. Once you're satisfied with your work, push your final code to the GitHub repository.
